I bought this to see if it would lower phosphorus levels for my mom who is a dialysis patient. We did some trials and blood work to see if there would be a difference. There was no difference. The product itself arrived quickly and in great condition. I don't know how well it would work for other uses but it did not do great for renal issues.,Not good for lowering phosphorus levels

"This reads like a first draft. 1. The characters are static, 2. The villains' motivations are not well thought out, 3. The setting is somehow both bland and overdone, 4. The pacing is rushed towards the end. It feels like the author got tired of writing and just slapped together an ending. This is the second book ever that I will take the time to completely remove from my Amazon account, not just delete from my device.",Not good. Reads like a first year writing student's reimagining of a 5th grader's plot
"I ordered the thong style slippers. I have a large space between my big toe and other toes, and always wear thongs and flip flop styles with no problem: however these slippers hurt my toes so badly that I am unable to wear them. The part that is supposed to go between my toes is set too far toward the inside of the shoe, thus making the toe bar pull toward my second toe so much that it hurts when I walk. They would be nice and comfy without that problem, but that is a HUGE problem. Wasted money, because I removed the tag before trying on and would cost too much to return. Sad!",Hurts too much to wear!
"I had read that with these kinds of devices you have more success with males dogs which I have a male dog so thought i'd give it a go.

So it's a nice idea but I think these things are very dog gender, breed and personality dependent as to if they'll work for you or not. At least they're not very expensive so if it doesn't work you're not out a whole lot of money.",Didn't work for my pup
"It's great to have a brush that also blow dries my hair! It was a little confusing what the 3 settings actually do. Thankfully, the seller sent an email to explain: LOW--Cool Heat & High Air Speed MIDDLE--Warm Temp & Low Air Speed HIGH--Hot Temp & High Air Speed **Please note that the sign of settings indicates the heat and temperature, not the air speed. In other word, there are 3 level of heat and 2 blower speed. It is different from other hair dryer and it is easy for you to have a confused idea that settings are broke.

I really enjoyed this humidifier in the beginning but now that we’ve had it for a couple months it seems to barely release any mist.

"Liars. This does not work with any other smart devices without their respective hubs. I had to buy the Hue Hub in order to get the Harmony hub to work with my Hue lights. Works acceptably as a remote. Does do its prime function of setting the 7 devices I have in my entertainment system for each type of media. It does set the TV sleep timer though when viewing via Apple TV so I have to turn the TV back on an hour into streaming. Stilling working on trying to find the software setting to fix this. I use my iPhone as the remote for the Harmony so I have to look at the display in order to get the correct “button” so I have gone back to using the cable remote to control the cable as I can do so by feel instead of by sight. Occasionally, the app loses volume control via the iPhone physical volume controls, but leaving and returning to the app corrects the issue.",Great to control ONLY entertainment devices

"It's cute and my son would probably love it if I showed him it to him, but I'm returning for a more traditional shape lunchbox. I think this will be difficult to pack and get things out of it.

"Do not buy these, spend a little more money and buy QD swivels from reputable companies like Magpul, BCM, Midwest Industries etc. One swivel works fine and the other one is full of problems. The button is mushy and gets stuck in the depressed position. I sprayed some liquid graphite in it and was able to get it to unlatch. However it won't stay in a QD socket at all, the smallest amount of force will cause it to pop out of the socket, which is very dangerous. Had it pop out of the QD socket twice at the range and nearly dropped my rifle both times but luckily caught it. Only buy these if your going to put it on a cheap rifle that you're not afraid to have potentially dropped, which kind of goes against the whole reason of having a sling in the first place. If you are looking for QD swivels for a duty rifle or any gun you'd depend on with your life then look elsewhere, these will fail when you least expect them to.

I originally tried the clear soap like this from the same manufacturer and added my own raw shea butter, but it came out to waxy. The amount of shea butter in this is perfect.

Just make sure you have a good badger hair brush to use with this. If you don't have a shaving soap container, you can use a small tupperware container with a lid.

"Literally just got this an hour ago. Bought it because my friend needs a headset and honestly so do I. I didnt wamt to pay for two high priced headsets so I took a look at cheap ones. Main thing I liked about this is the splitter jack. Years ago I had bought myself some headphones made by afterglow that came with a audio splitter. It was my favorite headset. Not only could you hear the gameplay and voice chat but you could also hear the music you played from your phone or other device. I got this in hopes of finding a cheap headset me and my friend could both have and also because I wanted that same audio splitter. Yes I could have bought a pricey headset with a splitter but like I said. I was shopping for a friend too so I didnt want to spend a whole lot. The reviews on this were good so I said lets do it. The product got to my door and I was excited. I unboxed the headset, read the instructions and configuration booklet and plugged it in. First thing I noticed. A sharp screeching noise when you try to turn up or down on the volume control. I had to set it to mid volume in order to not hear screeching but the gameplay audio was very low and there was a little bit of static in the background. I started a party chat to test if my whole party could hear the audio through my headset( have to check because cheap headset have an issue with your friends being able to hear what you are playing even when your tv volume is turned all the way down) and nothing. So I thought alright cool lets try talking. I spoke and no audio was transmitted to my party. I ended up having to twist and push in the headsets jack in order to use the mic ( yes I had it plugged in correctly) and when I spoke I could hear myself as well. That was with just the headsets jack in. The splitter does not work at all. Well not completely. The screeching issue when adjusting the volume was gone but all you can hear is the music you plugged in. Nothing else. You cant even talk to your friends anymore because the microphone is just simply unfixable no matter what you do. If you are going to get a headset put in the effort and money to buying a good quality headset. In the end you save more money.",Simply does not work as described
Although it came out fairly okay - had I not painted them they’d look really cheap.

"This iphone x case clear protection is thin, lightweight, and sturdy. I’m very happy with the designs and products. clear plastic designed with colorful rose flowers. It has a rim that runs all the way around the phone, Enhanced 4 air corner designs, it fits snug to the phone and fits comfortably in your hand. I have dropped my phone a several times and I have not had any issues. so when you lay the phone camera lens and screen-side down, the lens and screen does not actually touch anything. There are cutouts for all of the buttons, which I like. The case fits the phone extremely snugly, which gives it a secure feel, but you can still fit a thin magnet between the phone and the case for car mounting purposes, Easy to install magnetic bracket for use on cars and bikes. And never have I had one that was this resistant to scratches. It just looks and feels like my phone’s screen. The price was more than fair. In fact it was pretty cheap considering the quality of the product. As for the iphone x clear protection case, It’s practically fool proof and it came out perfect. It’s pretty great.

"This case was a bit hard to get on the phone, but once it was on, it seemed to fit snuggly and securely. Everything seemed fine and I think it would have been... BUT unfortunately, my wife's headphone plug did not fit the opening. As a result, she had to sort of peel back the corner and leave the case half off whenever she was driving or needing the headset. This was certainly inconvenient (at best). I was going to replace it, but before I could do so (after about 2 seeks of peeling it off and on / back and forth, the cover broke. The reason I gave the 3 star rating is because, had she not had this issue, I think the case would have been great. I'm sure it wasn't designed to be taken off and on every day or multiple times a day. SO, note to the BUYER, if you have a skinny plug, you should be fine, if not, try it before you use it - and thanks to amazon's great return policy, return it if it doesn't work.

"I ordered this to repaint some cabinet doors. They had your typical tongue-and-groove design, making it impossible to paint an even coat without it looking all globby. While I found out the paint I was using was also infuriating other customers (Valspar High Gloss Enamel SUCKS, is NOT ""self-leveling"" or ""easy to clean,"" and chips with the scrape of a thumbnail despite surface prep!) Overall, you have to clean this device quickly in between uses, but for this price point you can seriously knock some extra work and time off of a project that may take days to do the old-fashioned way. It was worth it to me! I will definitely be using it long into the future. Checkout a breakdown of various components below: Anyway, this product was fairly easy to use after perusing the instructions for a bit. While the viscosity cup provided is supposed to help indicate how much to thin your paint, it didn't really work for its intended purpose, as my paint was taking FOREVER to go through the funnel, way beyond any of the indicated times on the instructions. (For example, instructions indicate to add certain amount of water or thinner based on amount of time it takes for the paint to run through the funnel filled to the top). This led to some difficulty in figuring out how much I should dilute my paint, which led to some trial and error. However, most paint cans do have instructions for paint sprayer dilution, so that helped some! >APPLICATION - relatively easy but takes a bit of practice and increasing the velocity of the spray to ensure it is coming out in an even stream and not in splatters, which can also be affected a lot by how much you diluted it. Won't flow correctly if it is too thick. Difficult to do small applications of paint because you have to keep scraping the paint to the bottom of the container for it to be sucked through the straw. >DEVICE ITSELF - turns on easily, but I will say it the motor starts getting pretty hot quickly, which made me a bit nervous to use it for more than a few minutes at a time. Parts are all easy to assemble/reassemble. >CLEANING - While the parts are easy to clean, I frequently wished that I could put it down and come back to it later in between coats. Paint can be left in the reservoir if you seal it well with plastic wrap, but you have to run water through the sprayer otherwise it will get all dried up VERY fast with water-based paint once you turn it off. You 100% NEED a straw-cleaning bristle brush to clean the sprayer channels that don't detach from the device if anything dries up, otherwise globby and half-dried paint starts going through the nozzle and screwing up the spray pattern.","Good, and easy enough to use for the price!"

"I Really like it, but it’s not quite a love story; it’s very powerful, for something so small, and lightweight. However, the combination of how/where the hose exits the canister, and the size and number of wheels on the bottom, lead to a continual nuisance of tipping over. The plastic lever for switching out attachments is very cheap plastic, and broke as I was unpacking the vacuum. This may be a huge issue for some, but I don’t ever use attachments, so for me, no harm, no foul. The location of the power switch is a bit problematic as well, considering the other switch located in the mirror position on the back of the canister, causes the cord to retract. I’ve done this no less than 500 times. And no, for clarity, I am not a slow learner. That said, I do in fact, love that the vacuum has a retractable cord. I realize it is trivial, but for me, the winding and wrapping of a loose cord is just irritating. Not difficult, irritating.

"I've used this about 6 or 7 times and when its on right, it does the job. But the velcro sticking to itself and the straps tangling and adjusting the backstrap up or down is frustrating. Not good for customer satisfaction. I think longer straps would help a lot, but that could be a problem in public under a shirt. However, they could give that option or design a detatchable strap extension. And the people they use to model it are young, slim, and athletic. How realistic is that.! That's not their customer base. I'm 85 years old, 6 feet and 190 pounds. If they'd create a clear, detailed video tutorial it would pay them huge profits with positive reviews. ONE DAY LATER AND I'M EDITING THIS.... I added extensions to both straps and its so much better! As I said above, it does the job once its on right. I poked two tiny holes near the end of each strap and ran a thin, strong, plastic covered wire through to make a loop about 8 inches long. Problem solved!

"This movie is good. It is not great, but it covers a lot of bases. The directing is excellent, with camera work and scene structure that builds to a worthy end. The acting is great, with Renee Russo and Jake Gyllenhaal remaining captivating throughout. Gyllenhaal's character deeply flawed protagonist is excellent as it delicately balances multiple deep character flaws that leave you uncertain and curious to know what happens next. But the story is... unsatisfying. Anticlimactic. Poor. And far worse. Without spoilers I will do the best I can. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays a character who has no character arc, that is not the point of this movie. He starts off desperate and hungry for success, and he ends the same way. We only see the slightest suggestions of him becoming more successful, and we see how far he will go for that success - but this is not new, as we see him go just as far in the opening minutes of the film. Though I imagine everyone is expecting the movie and plot to go in a certain direction (because it is an absurdly cliche story that you have seen before in TV shows, other movies, and books), the movie ends up aiming slightly lower to avoid being entirely cliche. I am certain that at some point the writer/director realized that this was just another retelling of an old trope, and tried to edit the ending to make it a tad less obvious. It does not benefit the movie. Taking a trope and making it weaker does not make a strong movie, it makes a forgettable movie. That is what this movie is - incredibly forgettable. But that is not all that is wrong with the writing in this film. Gyllenhaal's character is clearly autistic (and the writer/director has confirmed this is intentional) to the point that this comes off as a hit piece about people with autism. I have worked with people on the spectrum and while Gyllenhaal's portrayal of an autistic protagonist is well done, the writing behind it disastrously misunderstands what autism is. While the writing has Gyllenhaal correctly neglecting enormous social cues, it also portrays him as obscenely manipulative, exercising such enormous control over social situations that it is absurd. To be frank, regardless of how high functioning Jake Gyllenhaal's character is supposed to be, he cannot both be autistic and simultaneously be so ridiculously successfully manipulative in social situations. This movie makes autistic people out to be self centered villains who will stop at absolutely nothing to obtain what they want. It is a disgustingly misinformed examination of autism. At this point you may be wondering why this movie has such high reviews. While it may be due to Jake Gyllenhaal's convincing glass eyed smiles or Renee Russo's believable portrayal of a struggling exec, I think it also has to do with a less impressive aspect of the film. This movie aims for low hanging fruit, criticizing the news media for being exploitative and corrupt. Literally all of America (and much of the world) has an issue with this right now, the only difference from person to person being exactly which stations they think are worse. I am not saying the media does not deserve this criticism (it really does), and the movie does an excellent job at portraying how ratings come before morality - I am just saying that this is the modern equivalent of making an 80's scifi movie where the military and government are the villains. But that is it. A huge cliche aimed at an easy target. A disgustingly inaccurate portrayal of a person with autism. A well directed movie with a very low goal that completely succeeds at what it is trying to do, but will be forgotten by the next day.","A movie that does many things right, but is not worth watching."

"Do not read the old reviews that rave this product. The quality is not what it used to be. I asked for a pair of these for Christmas a couple years ago. I have always had trouble with earbuds staying in my ears, so I thought I'd give these a try after reading the reviews. When I got them, I was pleasantly surprised with how easily and comfortably they fit. Then I plugged them in. I was immediately impressed with the sound quality. I used them all the time, working out at the gym, on long plane rides, and just sitting around and relaxing. Through some normal wear and tear, the wires split and stripped a little. Once that happened, the sound cut in and out. Since I loved these earbuds so much, I decided to buy another pair. They just arrived an hour ago. I am extremely disappointed, to say the least. The first thing I noticed out of the box is that the main wire is thinner, and much more flimsy feeling, than it used to be. Though, it is about a half inch longer. My first thought was wondering how long it would take for this pair to split with such flimsy design. Then I plugged it into my phone, which is where I listen to most of my music. I could immediately hear a downgrade in sound, which was so disappointing to me. I took my old pair and plugged them in just to make sure I wasn't imagining it. The old ones still sounded great!! My first experience with these earbuds was so amazing. That's why I had no problem spending $75 to get another pair. If I had known I'd be getting an inferior product, I never would have added these to my shopping cart. Poor sound, poor design. I have added a couple pictures. In one of the pictures, you can see my old pair with 3 splits and exposed wire. In the other, you can see the comparison to the new and old. Though I'm not sure how well you can tell the difference in thickness of the wire.","**DO NOT BUY** This product used to be excellent, but not anymore. Quality of sound and design is extremely disappointing."

"If you're wondering whether these are knock-offs, then remember you get what you pay for. These earbuds look and even feel like the real thing, but their sound quality is so bad it's clear that they're not. In a head-to-head with a pair of known, genuine Apple earbuds, the two pairs look identical, but sound remarkable different. It's clear the emphasis for these earbuds is looking the part but not carrying any respectable sound quality. Mind you, Apple earbuds aren't an audiophiles pick to begin with, but these sound so bad the difference between the genuine and fake buds is so obvious. Unless you're looking to use these exclusively for scratchy audio in phone calls, I'd keep looking.","Poor sound quality, albeit with the look and feel of the real thing"

"I ordered this recently and I thought I should give a balanced review. First, the product is cleverly designed and extends the practical life of older Bose headphones by making them Bluetooth enabled. Certainly they can be used in a wired mode, but that has become less and less convenient. The product fits well and is unobtrusive. It sounds fine. It can be charged without removing it and this is its biggest selling point over competitors. In the material, it says ""Built-in long lasting battery, charging 2 hours for enjoying up to 15 hrs music playtime or talk."" so I thought the battery would be fine. It actually only lasts between 3 and 4 hours. I contacted the seller and they responded: ""Hello, Thanks for your message, this adapter's battery life is about 5 hours, so it is normal to be that. And if the music is louder, the battery power will be lost more fast. Thank you "" So I was disappointed. If battery life is a priority for you, keep this in mind.",Battery Life is less than advertised

They are very lightweight, the sound quality is on par for what I'd expect, the battery life gets close to 3 hours, and I really like the idea of carrying case, although it would be even better if the top of it stayed attached when you open them. The hardest part for me was understanding how to get both of them to play music simultaneously. Basically, you need to let one of these earphones (doesn't matter which one) pair to the other BEFORE pairing either with device. If you pair with your device first, both of them will show up and you end up having an either/or situation instead of both. So once they're paired with each other, only pair ONE of your earbuds to the phone and VOILA, you have music in both ears!

"This is a relatively short story that fleshes out the background of the Bradford parents that we learned about from Nora in True to You. It's told in a modernized epistolary form, which is different & kind of a fun change of pace, but not what I would want as a norm, I think.

I have never used Beats, other than in the big box stores, so I cant really judge that review but these sure did blow the Pioneer set away. Much better bass and all around fidelity.

"This backpack has two large compartments of which the front one is rather narrow thus not allowing much bulky packing. The front compartment has several dividers for organizing pens, phone etc and the back one has a laptop sleeve and can fit a little more bulkier items (such as your lunch). This is a great backpack for commuting to work or carrying around the city on a regular day. It's not really designed for travel or hiking. The front ""leather"" material looks great. I initially had some trouble with the front zipper (due to the way the backpack was bent when shipping) but it quickly resolved itself. I highly recommend this item if you are in need of a smaller back pack that looks as good as a briefcase.","Sleek and compact, great for city commuting"

"This watch case lasted 16 months before the case back flew off after dropping the watch onto the floor. I recommend this as a travel beater watch that you won't mind losing. However, the band didn't last longer than three months for me before it started to delaminate after repeated cycles of sweating and drying. Thus I would recommend that you purchase more resilient aftermarket band that is less vulnerable to exposure to sweat if still considering this watch.

"Recent purchase is a cheap look-a-like. I purchased this chair in 2017 and like it so much that i asked my family to buy a 2nd one for me as a birthday gift this year. I sent my family the link from my order 2 years ago and they purchased it for me. But what arrived is not the same chair at all. I don't think there is a single part on the chair that is the same as the one from 2017. The brackets are thinner. The bolts are silver (as opposed to the brown ones previously that matched). The holes for the bolts don't line up causing the new chair to be crooked and putting pressure on the bolts. The cushions are smaller and more square (cheaper looking). The arms, legs, rockers, backrest, and seat are thinner. The vinyl is wrapped looser. The reinforcement under the seat has fewer straps to hold up the seat. Bait And Switch. The product has changed substantially and the company is taking advantage of years of good reviews but delivering a different product. Bait And Switch. Ive reported this to Amazon. As of today, the 5 pics at the top of the listing are of the chair i received 2 years ago. However, lower in the detailed From The Manufacturer section, the more current chair is pictured. It's not easy to notice the differences in those pics, but i'm telling you, the 2 chairs i received are not even close to the same quality.",Bait & Switch - Different chair than historical reviews
These labels look great and are very handy to label ammo boxes to stay organized. The ones I placed on top of ammo cases (on smooth surfaces) have stuck fairly well.

"It's really great and fun to mess around with, though I have two issues with it. Firstly, the colors for the magic used do not correspond to what it is meant to be. For example gravity is supposed to be purple but on mine it is showing up as red like fire would. Blizzard is meant to be blue but on mine it shows green like cure. My second issue is whenever I try to use the keyhole projection, it's not actually projecting it out. It makes the noises and everything and if I look into the actual part where the light is supposed to come from, I can see it but it won't project out for whatever reason. Other than those, everything else is great!",It's really great and fun to mess around with

"My 8yo daughter's hair is still baby-like, thin and fine and wont curl, but I'm also not all that great with doing hair so maybe it's me. This clip in thing was perfect for her hair! It matched perfectly and it was easy to do. All I did was pull her hair back in a bun and clipped it in. I used a few Bobby pins but it felt secure without it. She was so excited to show off her curly hair at the Daddy Daughter dance at school. She kept it on the whole time which surprised me because she is tender headed. She wore it again for picture day a few weeks later. After wearing it twice it's gotten frizzy and looks a bit messy but by reading other reviews I know to just wash and reset them. I've not done that yet because I want to read more and be sure of what I'm doing first. I will definitely buy more styles of clip ins for her since this worked so well!",Works great for Children's hair
"Pathetic design of the caps. Very impractical to use everyday. The caps close so tight that everyday we have to wrestle with the bottle to open the cap.

These are ok. On the positive side they didn't leak and they fit in our ski coat pockets (even youth). The downside is that they are almost impossible to dry out because the mouth is so narrow. Even in a very dry (desert) area. So they may not last very long.,Nice option but very hard to dry out

"If you are looking for a good slight wedge pillow with back supporting incline this is not the pillow for you. I purchased this pillow because I am a back sleeper and I wanted a slight incline and cervical support. I opened package let it completely expand. I then laid down for 15 minutes to see if it would work for me. Short answer is NOPE. It claims to be a very supportive memory foam wedge with support for your neck. They do not say that you need to have a specific length of neck for this pillow to be comfortable. I do not have a long neck, however it isn't that short. This pillow did not give the correct alignment for my cervical vertebra to be curved properly. Also the supportive part ends at almost a standard pillow size and then there is a soft floppy pad of light weight and very soft 1"" memory foam. That accounts for half the pillows length. After 5-10 minutes my lower back started to spasm. I will give benefit of the doubt here and add a disclaimer that maybe I happened to get a defective pillow. Maybe it was not up to the company's typical standards. I am returning it with no plans on exchanging it for another of the same pillow.","Not supportive....the pillow, not the company."

Not to mention that edge is where the adhesive is, so there's no getting rid if the dust. This all makes it blatantly obvious that there is a cover on the phone. The adhesive at the edge is the only adhesive, too. Which leaves the cover with gaps- now touch points are inaccurate. Typing on a touch screen is hard enough, now I have to ""push"" hard to record taps. All of the cutouts are in the edge as well, not surrounding the home button, camera, etc. And the fit isn't good around them either. Does it work? Yes, it protects the screen.

I have tried 4 different brake pads on the XC90 and these Bosch pads are good when warm and dry, but the worst of them all when cold and wet. Imagine you need to make an emergency stop when it is raining or snowing, good luck. I had to remember to keep on tapping on the brakes before stopping to be safe.

Anyway - I think I would have loved this hair clipper. But I am not willing to spend $50-60 to test something with potentially minimal lifespan.

It’s slightly better if you can keep the buds firmly inserted in your ear canal, but they seem to work their way out of the ear. They don’t fall off, but they back out. I think this is partially due to the small rubber tab that helps retain them to the outer ear. It’s angled slightly inward (toward the head), and this may put a tiny bit of pressure that gradually pulls the buds out as that rubber tab straightens itself.","Solid Bluetooth Connection to Apple Watch, mediocre sound."
"Carb looks and functions well. Fuel hose and clamps are useful but comes with the wrong primer bulb. Also the air filter comes crammed in the box, fortunately I had a Briggs filter on hand to install instead.","Wrong primer bulb, But the carb is good."
"After a few weeks, the right side stopped working on the first pair I purchased. Anker's customer support is very good though, replacement was sent to me quickly and haven't had any issues with the 2nd pair. I like that it comes with 4 different sizes of the piece that goes in your ear, and the part that you plug in is slightly less bulky than other similar headphones I've tried. They stay pretty comfortable even when wearing them for long periods of time, and the sound quality is as good as I'd expect for a $40 pair. I'll give this 5 stars if this second pair is still working in 6 months with no problems.",Pretty good for the price

"Protect your phone from dust, scratches and any impact with this case. Made from soft rubber TPU bumper and hard material back makes this case capable of protecting the phone on a daily basis. The rubber itself is transparent yet it has full and colorful sparkle bling glitter style design that makes it look more attractive.

"Fits well and of decent quality, but seems highly unlikely to be OEM as the item title states. It ships with black tape covering samsung and s6. I'm not sure if i didn't get any adhesive with mine, or its supposed to already be applied to the piece but it didn't stick very well. The tool is ok, but you will need a heat source to get the glue to weaken enough to get the glass started coming off. Mine was shattered so pieces of glass kept breaking off trying to get underneath it, but once it started it came off pretty easily. After having this installed a few months, its cracked in multiple places and glass is falling off.

"The product here worked as a video cord and it did provide video to the TV. The problem I ran into was that I still got the same, poor display of video, but I think it's because the new TCL Roku TV, doesn't like older systems. Even my plug and play joysticks that I have don't show up as well on the Roku TV. The Atari Flashback works perfectly fine however on the Roku TV.

These replacement filters works well in my Honeywell Humidifier. I use them every year during the Winter months and have never had a problem.

"These floor mats fit my 2016 RAV4 like they were built by Toyota. The material is durable and the lips around the edges allow them to collect dirt and debris. The only flaw I found was the texture on the trunk mat. I was hoping for something that had a little more friction. As is, my groceries slide all over the place on the slick surface. This would be a good thing if you have something heavy, say a big tent, cooler full of ice and drinks, and large luggage that you want to set on the edge and slide to the back of the vehicle. In that case, you don't want sticky friction making it more difficult. That is a rare case for me, as I am more likely to throw a cart full of groceries back there. That type of texture would have made it difficult to clean too, which I can appreciate. I like the texture on the rest of the floor mats where it makes sense. It is enough of a problem for me that I removed a star. I also removed a star because they are extremely expensive! I would have liked to see them more around $150 - $175. But I still bought them, and I do HOPE they last for the life of the vehicle, in which case, it is a worthy investment. If I have to replace them in 5 years, the cost would then be unreasonable. Overall, I highly recommend these floor mats to anyone looking to protect their 2016 RAV4 floors. They are very expensive and things in the trunk do slide around too much, but you won't find a better fit or better protection I think. 3/5 stars.

They're tight, but the fingers are way too tight. I stuck some 3/4"" dowels in the fingers over night & they're much easier to get on today. I think I'll like them. The grip is really good right now.

"I like this Wall Clock as the color is stylish and interesting and it is indeed non-tickling one so it is very quiet. For a noise-sensitive person like me, I can sleep well at night while the clock keeps working on the wall in my master bedroom. The only drawback for this clock I experienced was it was pretty hard for me to install a new AA battery in the back of it at the beginning, but it was not a major issue though. I hope the battery can last long enough to compensate the non-tickling technology that is the main feature of this wall clock. I suggest that the manufacturer smoothen the battery place in the back of the clock so that customers can install a new AA battery easily.",Stylish and Quiet Wall Clock

"Love the color! Love the Thickness! It’s going to be great for the frigid Northern VA winters. The only disappointment I have is the puff comes off too easily.

"The price was reasonable except that these sculpting tools were not ready to be used without sanding. They were barley in the shapes showed on Amazon. They are NOT ready to be used for smoothing or even medium fine details. These tools would cause more harm in sculpting than they would aid in artistic creating.

"Works very well. It is loud and if anyone moves my car door or opens it will go off. It also went off when I shut my other doors and shook the car hard. I tested to see if it goes off if I lean on the door or near it and it didn’t, so it is not likely to have that many false alarms. If anyone tries to harm your car or break in, they will need more force that just a simple lean or tap. Instructions in English and not too difficult to figure out.

"This cheap hamper might be okay for temporary use. ""Dorm use"" is a stretch and I definitely don't recommend it for a kids' room. The one we bought has been in use for exactly one year. You can see from the pictures that it is now falling apart. The fabric mesh has several small rips and is coming away from the seem in places. Two of the thin metal bands that hold the structure of this hamper have come loose. One of them is a loop and the other has a sharp terminal! The one that is a loop used to be very small. It stuck out just a little. Because the band is so thin in profile, it was invisible against the dark blue hamper full of dark clothes. It caught my toe as I walked by and ouch! It sawed between my toes as it pulled out from the fabric. I spilled my morning coffee all over the bathroom. We probably should have replaced this hamper months ago but I was being stubborn.

One thing that's great is that it holds a lot of cards without bending them as long as you don't try to move the book around in weird ways and what not. But that's about all this does. The book itself just looks like they took 2 x 20 page monster binders and then slapped them together into one binding, so overall its not really great for people who like to admire their cards frequently. Also, the outside material doesn't seem to be as tough as their other binders that are smaller, I wonder if this is because of the stress of having a larger capacity for cards or what, but the material on my particular binder is already starting to tear apart, but like I said, the cards are in good shape and are protected so I guess this binder is technically doing it's job haha. This Binder overall is great for people who buy/sell/trade a lot of their bulk and need something with a large capacity to carry all of their extra cards around, but if you want something that you can admire your cards in, just get the regular 20 page monster binders.","Good for bulk, that's about it."
"Came packaged well. Appears well-made. But does not do that great a job for making bullet coffee. First, instructions say this is not for hot liquids, but when I mix butter and MTC oil with almond milk, the butter never mixes in because the almond milk is cold. So I add a ""little"" hot coffee to help melt the butter... but the cup is so small that I can only add a very small amount of coffee, otherwise the result is a foamy mess when I try to remove the lid after blending. Bottom line, the cup needs to be bigger and the motor could be a bit stronger.","OK, but cup is too small and lacks blending power"

"The mattress topper is not comfortable for a couple, especially if they cuddle at night. The mattress concaved around my wife and I to the point that if either of us was close to the other it felt like we would fall into their hole. It was a lot like sleeping on a sagging air mattress. Maybe this topper is comfortable for those that sleep alone or maybe mine was defective - I have no idea why it is so highly rated on Amazon.",Not comfortable for a husband and wife
"I installed the lighting on the back of my 70"" TV. I quickly found that the USB port is always hot (powered) on this TV, so I need to use the included remote to manually turn the light strips on and off. I found the remote to be non-functional. I tried a new battery which did not work. After trying everything I could think of, I contacted the seller. I was told they would gladly send me a replacement unit, which they did. I got a replacement unit and everything works. I am very happy with the lighting and how it enhances our movie-watching experience.","Initial problems, but they made it right. Customer service was excellent."
"The screwdrivers themselves and the prying tool were pretty essential to installing the shell-replacer for the Switch, but there was some pretty rapid deterioration on the top of the screwdriver after the fact.

"The convenience of this pool cover is great, as it clamps conveniently to each leg of the frame. However, upon opening my pool this year, I noticed tears in various spots on the cover. It only went through one season! You would think the manufacturer understands that this Intex, 18' above ground pool is made for outdoor use, and the cover needs to have the same resistance to weather. I live in southern California, but the pool cover is tearing before being hit by the summer heat. It's only May! Color me very disappointed!","Tears in this cover after 1 season, not even summer!"
Product looks super sexy. The design is fantastic. Unfortunately... this product needs a 2.0 version. The presets are incredibly overly sensitive to even the slightest motion... I had to set all the presets to the same thing because even simply waving my hand over it would change it a different preset. The other built-in modes aside from the footsteps mode felt very underwhelming. Set-up was a breeze. Knob to change the sound level is fantastic. Just had way too many issues with the preset buttons switching non-stop to keep it. I also had issues hooking up the v-moda boom pro mic to it but I imagine a normal modmic or something else would be fine.,Works great when it... works
"Pros: - Strudy, solid handle, organizer compartment up top is nice, dust or water can't enter easily. - Design-wise, it looks nice and clean. I like that it's clear. Cons: - Mine came missing the buckle on the front. - The fatal design flaw is that that ""tracks"" on either side (where the hanging folder arms rest in) don't extend the entirety of the box sides. They just end mid-way. Thus, there is a full 1.25"" inch or so, in both the front of the back, where there is no track. Thus, you lose 2.5"" of folder space in the box. That ALSO means that every time I sort through folders and move them forward or backward, they easily pop out of the track. And that annoys the heck outta me. I would return it if it wasn't too late. It's ridiculous that the folders pop out every time I use the durn thing.","Cool Features, but Big Design Flaws"

I had to secure shelving for 4 huge reel to reel tape decks in my wooden stereo entertainment system. The little metal dows would not hold the old very heavy tape units by themselves.

"I have been finding it difficult to find some decent truck seat covers that don't cost an arm and a leg. I thought these would be just what I needed until I went to put them on and found out that our truck's head rests cannot be removed.

I purchased these coffee mugs because of the Swell reputation. The length of time that it keeps a product cold or hot is spot on from the advertisement. The one thing I do not like about either of these coffee travelers that I purchased is the drink spout. You flip it up to drink out of it but the part that you flip up is moist from either cold or hot drink whatever is in it. That part is in the way of your drinking and usually will get your face nose or whatever is near it wet. I have to constantly dry that flip part off before I drink my beverage. That’s why I gave it four stars.,One negative about the coffee mug

I can’t say enough good things about this product. I purchased it before rescuing my puppy and she has never known any other way of travel. She loves it. She jumps in her tube and it just relaxes.

This has fixed one of the few flaws in my v20, now I can comfortably go 2 full days without charging with moderate use with almost 7 hours screen time, while still maintaining fast charging. There are some minor short comings. The case does not offer much in protection as others have mentioned, the bump surrounding the screen is quite small. Also the screen protector will protect at minor scratches at best but not from drop damage as its not a full glass version. The front camera is also exposed.

The Mrs. and I decided to redo our light fixtures and we wanted dimmable vintage style lights. These were much cheaper than the local Home Depot / Lowes etc so I was a little wary of the quality and look.

If you're a fan of South Park, it's a no-brainer; however, it's not a perfect video game. The difficulty is laughably easy, and overall the RPG elements are good but not great.
