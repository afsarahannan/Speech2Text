"What should I say to William Painter? I ordered the sunglasses to Germany. The first thing I received was a pair of bent sunglasses. They complained that I had to pay the costs for the return myself, they are about $40. I got a new one, it has been used before. You can see from the fact that the cloth was not properly folded and the case dirty. I also had to pay the costs for the customs myself, about 60 $. So the sunglasses cost me 100 $ more. Pro: good glasses, looks good, fits well. I can't say anything about that. Contra: I find it a cheek that I got used sunglasses, especially after the first pair of glasses was bent and clearly had a mistake and my ass was sweetened by William Painter. And then there are the extra costs. Conclusion: Who does not come from the states and on gambling stands then she orders you. No recommendation",is a game of luck
I use this for knitting. Really like that I have 3 different lighting options. Light weight and comfortable. I will be taking this with me wherever I go.,Good light for all your needs
"Item arrived quickly and looked to be in good condition, even included battery pre-installed. However, even though it should have been compatible with my 1999 Buick LeSabre, the remote failed to program or synchronize with the car. The instructions are easy enough and I know that I was following them correctly because I was able to successfully re-program my old remote fob. This new one, however, would not work and so I will be returning it. There was no problem with the seller or service, it just seemed that this particular item was defective or incompatible with my vehicle.",Didn't work with my 1999 Buick LeSabre
"I purchased the 33"" and 36"" crate for the bedroom and one for the family area. I purposely purchased the 2 door for both so I can have options to position in either room although when using the puppy divider it clips on the side door so this door is not functional until the divider is not longer needed. Also, the divider clips well to one side but is loose on the other side and it is not a tight fit for safety. I did call Midwest support and they were very nice. They did confirm that with a 2 door the divider does not work. They requested pictures of the clasping issue with the divider on one side. Not sure there is anything to be done and my little girl is coming home in 2 days so I will just deal with it. It is a sturdy crate and has little rubber rollers on the bottom to help moving but take care moving over hardwood floors as it did touch it somehow without lifting and just rolling. Had to give 3 stars since the divider does not work with the 2 door option. This was very important for my needs.",Puppy Divider with 2-door Crate is not Functional
"I'm have thick curly hair that I have to apply a lot of heat to just to get it semi-straight. And because I use only coconut oil it tends to leave my hair with a cooked kind of smell. This spray works! I sprayed my hair all over one time and it immediately cancelled the coconut odor out of my hair. The scent smells so nice and it's lightweight. I could smell it for about an hour or two and then it faded, but It totally canceled all the odor out of my hair...no more cooked smell. And I can use a little bit every day every time I curl my hair and it doesn't dry it out or change the texture whatsoever.",Works 100% on curling-ironed hair
Shipping was fast but I am kinda disappointed with this product because it didn’t work out for me. The price is cheap but the quality is cheap but you get what you paid for.

This product is worth the purchase and does what it says. Perfect rice every time and very easy to operate (remember to hold your finger down for a second or so to get the proper feedback on the touch display). I'm giving it 4 stars because cleaning it isn't so simple. The pot that sits within the product is great. It's non-stick and easy to clean. My issue is with the lid that closes down to seal the rice/food. I've looked up how to remove and clean these components on YouTube and other sites without helpful results. Reading their instruction manual offers the most minimal assistance and is rather insulting. What I've had to do is wipe it clean with a rag on the counter with soap and then wipe the soap off with a clean rag over and over until it's clean. I'd prefer a removable top that can be washed in the dishwasher and was a little dumbfounded when I realized it didn't work that way considering the price compared to cheaper $20 units I've used from places like Target. If you purchase it you will see what I mean. If I'm wrong and there is a way then I still blame the manufacturer for not making it more obvious.,Perfect rice every time and very easy to operate (remember ...
This fan was checked out before the installer left. Later that day I turned it on and the globe was wobbling a lot. He was able to return the next day and discovered that the screws fastening the globe were loose already. He replaced them with some bigger screws he had with him. That was two weeks ago and the fan is still fine. It is very attractive and quiet.,The screws aren't big enough.
"I really Like this ring light! It is wonderful for the price and it gets the job done! The only issue is the light bulb heats up too fast and the light goes out, so I have to turn it off wait for a while then turn it back on.

We located the correct fuses, checked them with a multi-meter and everything. Still, nothing. Turned out, the grounding screw in my car wasn't good. We had to find another one. Also, you have to charge the Power Magic Pro a little bit to get it going.

"I have seen a few ants around my apartment almost every day recently, so I bought this little device to see if it works. It is actually pretty effective. I have not seen any ants for days now. It is so easy to use. I just plugged it into my electrical outlet and it works just like that. It even has a small blue LED light, which looks quite bright at night. One downside is that it would take up 2 slot on your outlet as the device is quite long (about 4-inch long and 2-inch wide). It is also effective for small area. If you have a big house, they recommend to have one for each room, which will add up quite a lot of money. Overall, it works well for my small apartment.",It seems to chase away my ant problem

"3 1/2 Stars Remedy is a brothers best friend romance as well as a second chance romance mixed into one. It's a unique story, and the hero (Grady) has to do everything to get Collins back and prove he's the guy for her. Three years ago, Grady and Collins had an amazing night together. Collins thought she was finally getting everything she dreamed of, her brothers best friend... but when she woke up alone the next morning, and never heard from her, things definitely changed. Now Grady is back, and he's not leaving, and he's doing everything in his power to prove to her why he left, and that he's not giving her up this time around. While I loved the premise of this story, and at times Grady, he really got on my nerves. I totally understand his reasoning for leaving that night, but to not even send a letter to Collins explaining himself? To leave her wondering and hurt for all those years, and then expect her to welcome him back with open arms? Was he delusional?! Collins was right to be upset, angry, hurt, etc. She was right to put up a fight with him when he wanted her back and to move forward. I admire her will power, because Grady was persistent. I loved Collins in this book, she was strong, and she guarded her heart, and I admired her for that. Sure she loved Grady, but she was scared, and hesitant to let him back in her life, who wouldn't be after what he did to her? Her character was definitely my favorite out of the two. She definitely let things go at the pace she wanted, and when she was ready to listen, she listened. There is a lot of angst in this book, and I did enjoy watching these two reconnect when Collins started to forgive Grady, I just wish Grady would have not come off as so whiney and would have been a little more understanding. He kept saying he understood, but at times he was a little too pushy to me, and then he was sweet towards the end. I ended up loving him just as much as Collins, but in the beginning of the book, I had a hard time reading his points of view because I couldn't connect with his character. The first part of this book, was not my favorite, but he second part? I adored, hence my rating. If you like second chance, and brothers best friend romances, you may really enjoy this book, I just had a hard time with Grady at first and how he handled some of the things he did.",Loved Collins...

"Used with an adult cat. Based on other reviews I should note there are two main reasons for a cone. To keep an animal from scratching their head, OR to keep an animal from biting or licking their body. This is only good for the second scenario, which is what I needed it for. The cat does not like it as much as the clear plastic cones, but any of those big enough to keep him from licking his sores also prevent him from eating and drinking. This keeps him from reaching his incision (rear leg amputated) with his mouth, but he can still get to food because it is cloth. It does seem to make him feel more trapped and bummed out, but out of the three I ordered, it is the only one that covered the medical need.","Will keep them from biting their body, not from scratching their head."

I’ve had my outdoor nest camera on my front porch for one year now. My subscription just ran out which is $100 per year. The camera is pretty useless without the subscription. When you have the subscription I can distinguish people from Pats or motion of trees blowing in the wind and sounds versus voices. Now that my subscription is over it can’t do any of those things is just notifies me anytime there’s motion and it can’t distinguish. It doesn’t even routine video for five minutes so you can go back and look and see who was on your porch because by time you receive the notification there already gone so the live feed is really ineffective unless someone hangs out in front of the camera for an extended period. So if you’re comfortable with being stuck with a subscription every year at $100 per camera then it is a decent camera but it’s useless without the subscription. I’m looking into other cameras where I don’t have to have a subscription.,***Only works if you pay for subscription***

"This ring was beautiful. I loved the design and the chunky feel of it; it looked expensive and it was very comfortable! The only reason why I gave only 3 stars and ultimately returned the product is because I realized I wouldn't be able to wear it all the time. I like to wear my rings all the time, which is why I always make sure to get sterling silver, and I know some people said that their rings tarnished after a while, but I had worn mine for about a week straight - even while washing my hands - and noticed no tarnishing. Interestingly enough, the issue I had was that the inner band of the ring was actually turning my finger white and moist - kind of like the way a bandaid does after you leave it on for a long time. This happened even when I made sure the ring and my finger was completely dry. I don't know why this happened and have never had it happen with any other ring, but it became uncomfortable so I decided it wasn't the ring for me. :( Too bad because I really did love it!

It looks great. Good quality. Only thing is the team names arent attached on the plate itself. It is 2 plastic plates glued to the metal frame. So word of advice. Is to put super glue on edges of team names. And that should hold longer.,Rep your team anywhere your from.
I bought 2 of these for my 2 new iPhone 8s and this mount holds the phone securely to the magnet and charges the phone without an issue. Problem I have with both mounts is the phone starts to droop down as I'm driving from the weight of the phone. I don't see any screws to tighten to stiffen the joint so I might have to use some kind of glue to hold it in place. Great concept but it's a bit cheaply made and the quality shows.,Droops down from weight of phone
"I love this water bottle. I drink a lot of water and I like it cold, so this suits me. I don’t use ice and the water still stays cold all day. Granted I don’t have it sitting in a hot car or directly in sunlight, as I’m sure that would effect the temperature some. I bought the pink one for my mother and she loves it as well. I’d recommend getting the straw tops that are sold seperately. Ours work fine and I’m happy I purchased them. However, the fact that the straw tops are an extra $10 a piece and the water bottle is almost $50, this is very overpriced for the quality of the product. I don’t regret buying it, but this is more of a luxury item IMO.","Love the product, Hate the price."

"The child hat is ridiculously small. It was not even close to the right size for my 3 year old son. I checked the size, and it wouldn't have even fit him as a newborn.

I am a size 10 and I ordered a L. It is huge and boxy on me. The sleeves are even too long ( I am 5'7 so its not that I have short arms). Maybe a small would have fit better. I would return it but I didn't try it on when I got it and now it is too late.,Really big and boxy. Order size down.
I think the quality is first rate. The only drawback is the roll over top hem. It leaves a big dent where it rests on my calf. The other 20/30 support hose I bought has a different top band . It is a different weave and is more like a band and leaves almost no indentation on my calf.,Good quality product except for an overly constricting top band.
"Edited review (POST-con): LOVE this wig!! It's SO CUTE on and I got so many compliments for my Wreck it Ralph 2 costume!!

"We ordered this set for our Switch because it was a good balance between the price of wired controllers (cheap) and functionality of wireless. Overall the controller works great - good ergonomics, buttons are satisfying, sticks are usable, gyro seems to work, low latency. My only complaints : 1) the rumble is really, really extreme. So much rumble. Some kind of setting to turn it down would be great. 2) the binding procedure was a little weird, but well-explained in the (marginally) translated instructions. Would definitely recommend if you need a couple extra controllers for when friends come over. For a daily driver or to be more pro, some of the more expensive options might be better.",Great controller. Great price. Maybe too much rumble.

No effort to ship over night or provide a more expeditious delivery what so ever. how can anyone even consider buying here for black Friday or Christmas. Amazon wants to act like they are still the only option for online shopping. I could just have easily order this on homedepot or lowes or Walmart online. I could have received this same day had I gone to the store. And it is much easier to return something is there is issues with the alternatives. So why doesn't Amazon provide better service? I questioned myself, why do even shop on amazon? I suppose with the other options I won't any longer.",NO Amazon for black friday or christmas

"I purchased this bike for the sole function of being able to be folded in half so I can fit it in a car easier. As far as accomplishing that task, it is wonderful. Now to the nitty gritty. The bike comes with a Shimano rear derailleur, which works well as you would expect from a known reliable manufacturer. However, both of the shifters and the front derailleur are cheap aftermarket brand and NOT Shimano, despite how it is described. The shifters are loose between each gear stage, and too stiff to shift up to higher gears in some cases. The front derailleur is very difficult to adjust because of its cheap make, and the metal it is made out of is also very cheap and the whole derailer became unusable after spending some time just trying to get it adjusted. The seat pole is too long and interferes with the frame suspension, but that can be easily solved by cutting off a few inches of the pole. Basically, if you're someone who knows a lot about bicycles and how they work, this is a great bicycle frame with a unique design that can be very useful, but out of the package it immediately will need a few modifications and new front derailleur and new shifters if you plan to use this for serious riding.",Great frame but the rest of the bike parts made cheaply
"The quality is great, but the sizing is off. They run small. Also, make sure it fits loose on your male pup and that the elastic doesn’t rest directly on his privates..when it’s too tight, it hurts their privates and causes irritation, rash, bruising and scabbing. I learned the hard way. You will need to put an overnight maxi pad or something in there & wash them. I soak them in white vinegar & water before a cold water wash with free & clear detergent. Then hang dry. I bought a size Medium for my 12 lb. Toy Poodle and realized he needed a Large, so I am ordering again.

"Firstly don't believe the rating here. Fakespot.com gives it a ranking of D, which means it is very likely that there are a lot of fake good reviews here. Pro: The robot is a new category of toy, or you can even call it a pet. It go explore by itself and it does not require a phone to do so. It wakes up in the morning and wanders around and makes cute noise. It greets you when you get home (you have to make sure that he hears you and sees your face though). In summary, being autonomous is a major pro that you can't see from other products. Cons: 1: too slow in processing your command. I think the chip is from 2015. So can't expect too much in terms of processing speed. Also you can't expect it to be that smart because of this. 2. Edge detection is just NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Sometimes it just runs at full speed and falls directly off the edge. The worst part is that sometimes when it's right on the edge, it misunderstands to be on air. This causes it to act irritated and shake its arms and fall off. I don't think this is merely a problem of software. 3. It gets boring. Soon you'll realize its movements and responses are just algorithms and predictable. You get bored of it after no longer than a week. A toy is just a toy at the end. You don't want to spend $250 and eventually forget about it. In summery. It is a new and interesting experience to have a robot like this. But it is still very limited and you get bored of it very quickly. If you have extra money and really want the new experience, just get it. If you're debating whether to get it or not, don't trust the positive reviews here and forget about it -- it does not worth $250 (or even $150) yet.",My thoughts after 2 weeks of use

Until the epilogue, I'd been thinking the story was too improbable to be great, but I was thinking I'd probably wind up buying her others eventually.

For me it ruined the main character.",Improbable but a good story until the end.
"The adapter does what it's supposed to and is a nice size. Doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Biggest drawback is that when the adapter is plugged into the computer, it covers up the other USBC port making it impossible to charge the computer and use the adaptor at the same time. If you intend to use this adaptor to quickly transfer files back and forth then it's no big deal, but if you want to use it to back up your device, or edit files on a hard drive (something that you can't easily unplug w/o losing access to the files) then you should splurge the extra 5 bucks for one with a cord.

"I'm still trying to remember why I liked Age of Myth, the first novel in this series. Whatever that was, it wasn't really present in the sequel. Though some of the characters are engaging and the overall story line is interesting enough, this book takes a few leaps that seemed forced in order to level the playing field between two races. A society going from the stone age to the copper age to the iron age (and discovering many of the technological and cultural advancements that come with those transitions) in a matter of weeks thanks to recurring epiphanies by two or three characters... well, let's just say it's all a bit rushed and bordering on repeated examples of deus ex machina (a phrase I've never used before, but which seems entirely appropriate in this case).

"This is a decent example of a 2-piece case for the Axon 7 that doesn't add as much bulk as an Otterbox. The hard piece wraps securely around the sides of the phone, but the soft layer is actually very easy to peel back over the top and bottom, meaning you could very likely drop the phone at an angle such that the silicone peels back as it impacts and thus doesn't protect the phone at all.

"Over all, a nice dog house, but contrary to what the description says, the roof does not come off. Ok, in theory one could take it off if one wanted to remove a bunch of screws and didn’t mind the whole thing falling apart. So, it really does not come off. That said, the doorway is huge and I don’t think it would be difficult to wash it out that way. The assembly was easy enough by following the pictures. Although a couple of screw holes didn’t line up perfectly, these were not much of a problem. I doubt that the house would be completely water proof - maybe - but I’m using it under a patio, so that is not an issue for me.

"These worked reasonably well for a while... I actually used them non-stop (except to charge) for 5 days after I got them. This is my first pair of bluetooth earbuds and I was impressed at the battery life. They easily lasted 8+ hours, and charged quickly. After the initial 5 day spurt of use I would only use them intermittently afterwards, and they continued to work fine and held a charge when not in use well as long as they were powered off obviously. The downsides to these... the volume was not all that loud. Sometimes I was using them in louder environments (at a race track, on a plane) and I pretty much had to have my computer or phone at max volume to hear them easily. I was not listening to music most of the time, typically talk radio or shows so this could have contributed to why I had to have the volume maxed the entire time. Along those same lines, the noise isolation is nonexistent. So that really doesn't help matters when the volume does not go that loud. The real problem came when after 4 months of ownership they just stopped working. They will no longer connect to any device for longer than a second or two before they immediately disconnect. I've contacted Optoma for a warranty replacement so we will see how that goes. So far it has been 3 days and I still have not received my RMA slip. GIven the relatively low amount of use these saw I am very disappointed that they failed so early. But the accessories they come with are excellent, I really liked the pouch as I could keep it clipped to the exterior of my travel bag so the headphones were always in easy reach when I needed them. The pouch could use a little mesh pocket inside to keep the charging cable contained, but that is another minor gripe about the whole setup in general.",Good when they worked - failed after 4 months

For the price of these leggings I would say they are not good quality. They are very see through. Even if you take your hand and stretch the fabric you can see directly through it. These leggings are extremely long. I am 5'6 and normally need a long inseam and these are much too long for me.

After I was washed it even more shedding. There was rust in the hair. Yes, that’s right RUST. Perhaps it’s from being stored for a long time but the combs were rusty. Even some parts of the lace had rust on it. This is very disappointing but you get what you pay for. I had a wedding to go to last minute so I thoroughly washed it and even disinfected it with Lysol.

I can't say enough good things about about this purchase and this computer. I will definitely use them again.,Outstanding service and a great product.
Good value considering the price. The grommet for the handle came off within 2 weeks but not a big deal for me. Overall I'm happy with it. Design and color is great.,Best if you don't need or use the wrist leash.

"I was surprisingly excited to try this gadget. It came in a really nice looking box within a box and it was easy to figure out how to use it. Be careful the first time you try it, because even on the lowest setting it has really powerful suction. The first spot I tried bruised before I figured out how to detach it from my skin. You may want to practice it on a less delicate area than the face the first time you use it. PROS: -very nice box with magnetic closure - nice assortment of tips - includes detailed instructions (in varying quality of English) - has very strong suction power CONS: - easy to bruise your skin with this - didn't seem to have much noticeable effect, at least in the short term.

"While this product does work to keep the reflux in check, the side effects were pretty intense - bloating , gas for many hours after. I used it several times and got the same exact reaction. I think this may be due to the artificial sugar alcohols used to sweeten the tablets. Too bad they don't make a cleaner version of this.

"This item had an issue with the #1 key right out of the box. Unfortunately, I purchased it in August and I didn't get a chance to return it in time so I'm stuck with it now. I also purchased one of these in July of last year, and it completely died with no reason or warning. It wasn't dropped or abused in any way, just completely stopped working, even with new batteries. That's what led me to purchase this one, which adds a ""1"" to the numbers you're typing in if you hit any of the numbers close to the 1. It also seems to omit numbers that you feel like you've typed, so the keys on this one are very inconsistent and temperamental.

"There was some question on as to whether or not these were solid stainless steel or not on the listing. Since the seller made a point of saying they were solid, I decided to give it a shot. The bad news: my grill was 1/2"" too wide, so I had to saw off the nubs on the end of the grates to fit. The good news: they are definitely solid stainless as advertised, so I am not worried about these grates de-laminating like my old factory grates. Glad I bought these.

The nice feature of this is that the middle leg has a USB charging connection on the end so you do not have to search for a wire connector. When it is charging the light glows red until fully charged and the it goes out. The lamp also has multiple intensity levels so you can adjust for brightness and loss of battery power. The clip is a bit problematic with paperbacks - a longer jaw would be better. The lamps flexibility is stiff so it holds it shape nicely.,The nice feature of this is that the middle leg has ...
"As per the instructions I charged the batteries fully before the first use. This took 14 hours which is much longer than the suggested three hour charge time. After the charging was complete I paired the socks with the included remote control. Pairing each battery was actually pretty easy, once of the nicest things about these socks. The socks fit my feet well. You can easily feel where the wires are but it only took a couple of minutes before you forgot they were there. Once the sock were on I connected the batteries and tucked them away in their respective pouches. The using the remote I turned the socks on High. After an hour I pulled each battery out of the pouch to check the indicator light, sure enough the light showed that each battery was on high but I couldn't feel any warmth on my feet. And this was on High. I kept the socks on for four hours, at about the third hour I started to feel a hint of heat. The reason these socks didn't meet my expectations and received a two star rating is because of the exceptionally long charge time as well as it taking three hours before I felt any hint of heat. Even at hour four there was very little heat on the High setting. I didn't test Medium or Low.",Failed to warm my feet.

"This is a very nice skirt. The lacy pattern is classy and soft. It doesn't wrinkle, even after being crammed into plastic and a box it was very smooth, so that's really cool. This can easily be dressed down or dressed up, and has a kind of vintage feel due to the length and cut, which I'm really into. I think this could be flattering on anyone.

"I want to love it, it's a solid tool and I got it because my friend used his chain breaker with this tool to save me on a long bike ride. The case is cool too. But why only 3 stars? Well it fell apart on me on a couple occasions and the parts went every where. Kind of sucks that I need a tool to fix a tool. And when it fell apart the first time I didn't and then I guess my hand tightening wasn't enough. I've still yet to dig around to fine the correct size tool to fix it. I don't even see why it is so easy to take apart? Also I wish I would have gotten a tool with a 15mm. On it's own it wouldn't be a huge deal especially since a couple of my bikes don't need it, but enough of the bikes I work on do. Even if it was like an optional side item. I've seen other tools for the price and size with it. So to sum it up. It's not a bad tool, I've done some wrenching with it. I've also had to wrench it and it's parts have fallen on the ground on more than one occasion, for the price I wish I would have gotten something else.","Hmmm it's a cool tool, but its fallen apart after little usage and no 15mm.

Why they wouldn't dispatch another one is beyond me, so I had to stack amps and EQ's on a table and buy some rubber feet to put between them so they didn't slide around. Real professional looking to have $6K in gear stacked on a table. So, it may be ok if you get one- but chances are you won't, or at least you won't get all of it like SO many reviews state.

I like this series. The main characters are unusual and very damaged from a terrible childhood. Will is an excellent investigator but due to a disability he believes he is illiterate. Slaughter does a very good job showing how people with dyslexia learn ways to hide their limitations. It will be interesting to see how these characters play out in the future. I understand that Slaughter brings some of the characters from the Grant County series to this series. The crimes are brutal. I'm sure this is a good representation of what police come across in their career. The procedural is well done and kept me interested from start to finish. I'm looking forward to reading more of this series soon.,What a start to the Will Trent series.

This book was one of a number of books which I have read on this subject. It is good to read about people who show compassion; in the hope that it leads one to follow in the steps of decency and courage. It also shows that there were people on the side of the aggressor who did not want to carry out the atrocities of the governing body at the time. This holds true in the world today and brings to mind that wealth and power are not worth loosing our compassion and dignity for.,An Entertaining And Thought Provoking Read.

When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.",Avoid Wifi connection- go Bluetooth!
"Bought two of these for international travel and have not been disappointed in the slightest. I'm currently sitting in a hotel room charging a Surface Pro 6 using the PD port and an adapter, plus an iPhone Xs Max from the QC 3.0 port, plus an iPhone 8 from one of the regular USB ports, and it's handling all three with no issue whatsoever.

I bought two sets. In White. One came with a couple light brown stains. Maybe dirt. Who knows. The lining plastic package was torn. Washed them immediately after arrival with TIDE & dirt removed!

"The instructions tell you to push the plug up through the hole in the baffle and ""Make sure it is securely in place."" HOW??? It is designed so that the baffle simply sits loosely on the plug, so that it can be pushed up by any critter or the slightest wind. You can turn the plug upside down so that the thumb screws are on the underside of the baffle, but it will take you hours to turn those screws; no tool will do it, and only the tiniest fingers would have an easy time of it. It took me over an hour to do a half-baked job of getting them screwed in so as to secure the baffle to the plug. It is a complete PITA. I ordered four of these; the three that I didn't open are going straight back and I'm in the market for better weather guards.

"The problem is any missing instructions what to do with the product after arrival. It smells horribly, it colours all water yellow. From web I found that I should soak it for a long time (in my case I soaked it for 3 days replacing water several times). This removes significant amount of colouring and smell. Then you should use it empty. You will see how much yellow the water under the steamer is. If it is still quite a lot and the steamer smells, keep soaking, if it is just tinted with yellow and the smell is very faint, steam empty steamer several times and soak after each steaming. (i do not know if the instructions are correct but this is what I found by trial and error. Finally, when you cook food, always put baking paper under it. Especially if you steam fish. After steaming, I suggest soaking for half an hour in water. Soaking = immerse fully in water.",a lot of work to make it usable

"Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing. I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests. I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch. It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone. For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder. Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out. There's no music in the mic itself though. It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic. Or you can even sync your Spotify app. Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately. The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!) and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room. Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic. If you've figured this out, I'd love to know! 2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky. I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker. 3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting. If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.",Cool concept!

Bought this for wheatgrass but barely any juice from a whole tray of homegrown. The juice always comes out from the pulp chute first everytime for some reason until pulp clogs it up. Does Soft fruits and vegetables great but harder ones need to be cut into smaller pieces. Harder types tend to have dryer pulp than the soft which come out pretty wet for some. Relatively easy to assemble but theres couple rubber pieces that needs to be removed to cleaned and remember to put back when it dries or it will leak. Cleaning the pulp out of the tiny chute is a pain and nearly impossible if it gets clogged up. The screen on the other hand is impossible to get fully cleaned no matter how much you scrub it. The fiber will cling to the mesh screen on first use.,Decent juicer for fruits and vegetables but..
"This thing really works to lessen the impacts. Definitely makes a hard tail bike ride much nicer. It is well made, except that there is a little more play in the bushings that I think is needed.

The first one I purchased broke after about a year so I went and order another one. The new one snapped in half while attached it to the hose. I barely tightened the thing at all and I'm not an olympic body builder or something. Very low quality.,Broke before I could even use it once
Arrived with a dent in the lid. Packaging was great so I assume it was shipped that way. Shame because other than that it is another quality Stanley product. Not worth the hassle of returning for replacement.,Nice but inspect upon arrival
I hardly ever write bad reviews but this pair of shoes are so narrow and they are supposed to be M. The outside of the shoe looks like plastic or vinyl definitely not leather. I hate to return but I will give these shoes to the Goodwill.,Would never wear or buy these shoes!

"The end of the Car Pool fits perfectly in most plastic bottles from water or soda. The extension is highly flexible making it easy to position and use.

"When you order a product, you expect the product to be as described. They were advertised as CAP Dumbbells. However, the product received was Golds Gym dumbbells. If I wanted Golds Gym, I would have bought these from Walmart. I have a complete set of CAP dumbbells, with the exception of my one set from Golds Gym. Is the weight correct, yes. Due they perform, yes. I just expect to get what I paid for not something else. After reading a few other reviews, I see that others have had the same issue.","Be careful, you may get CAP or you may get Golds Gym."
"I do like this product a lot. I set the 7 programs daily for my pool pump in Florida, where during the summer the pump has to run 8 hours each day to prevent algae growth. With this timer I can run the pump with intervals during the 24 hours of each day, such that the pool water is never sitting still for long times. I took off one star, because it was hard to cut the holes to the right size for the electrical connections. One of the pre-marked holes broke off to a bigger size than I needed.",Great for a pool pump
"This is a great gift for any kid that is a plane enthusiast. It was really easy to put together, but one down fall is that the tail piece doesn't seem to snap in very well, so it can be pulled off rather easy. The other wings seems to snap in tight and there are no issues with those. The lights are really bright, and the speaker is loud enough, but not too loud. It doesn't seem to work on carpet very well, but works great on wood floors or outside in the driveway. Over all great gift, it would be a 5 star if the tail piece didn't off so easily.",Great gift for the plane enthusiast
I used this product to cover the drawers of an old dresser. Now it looks very chic and expensive. I would definitely recommend this product to others. I used a felt covered applicator (just search Amazon for wallpaper kit) and I didn't encounter any bubbles with the product. Very easy to use if you have the right tools.,Great way to freshen up old furniture.
"I bought this as a tracker to use while I swim, and I didn't even get a proper chance to try it. First off, it's not water resistant and it is not recommended to use while swimming per the instruction manual. Second, it doesn't come with a charger. Instead, it suggests to use a USB plug or computer. Fine, we have lots of those around. When I try to get it into the port to charge it, however, it launches right back out. I'm not sure if there's something not compatible or if this is just poorly made, but I'm not going to sit and hold my device in while it charges. Lastly, the app keeps popping up ads, even when it's closed. Ads popped up while I was sending a text, which is very concerning. I then closed down all active apps on my phone, and saw yet another ad when I went to check the time 20 minutes later. Horrible product, I guess I get what I paid for...","You get what you pay for. Horrible product, misrepresented"
We’ve had this for over a year now. My daughter and her friends love it BUT I don’t think it will last too many more years. The cedar is fading quickly. The table is very wobbly. If there are more than 2 small kids swinging at a time then the whole thing rocks back and forth even being staked in the ground. We will have to start replacing boards very soon to allow the kids to continue playing on it safely.,You get what you pay for.

Seem to work. Just as cheap as the originals that came on the Cargo trailer. Remember the weird looking screw head is likely just a square drive and not a torx or allen.

If you don't have any wind or Employees that don't pay attention you may be o.k.,"UPDATED Works, both broken within a Year"
Can't say the product has worked or not until I see if it extended the life of the connecting cable. To be honest I would've like that the Klip covered part of the connector.

"Purchased these on April 6, 2018 and one just burned out. Today is May 9, 2019. They lasted just a little over a year and now I need replacements.

They were OK for the price point.",OK Bulbs but Lifespan not great

Very disappointed.",Fits but won't stay in place.
"We bought one of these. Returned it, bought another. Stupid mistake. I don’t know if we had bad batteries but we ordered two of these. They last a couple of hours and die. Not worth the money, to put new batteries in every couple hours. Not the headache now of taking the tape off the walls. Ugh.",Goes through batteries on a few hours! Not worth the money.
"At first, I was unlucky to receive a defective unit that lasted two months. I sent the company a private complaint (admittedly, a little bit too bitter), and they responded immediately in a way that surprised me: ""We sincerely apologize and we just shipped you a replacement. We want you to be happy with our product."" They didn't ask for a proof of the problem nor to send my defective unit back. I got the replacement in just two days after I complained!

"This is not a good kettle if you live with other people who might be asleep when you are using the kettle. I contacted the manufacturer and there is no way to turn off the sound feature. Edited from one to three stars because they gave me the kettle for free which was nice, but there was a ton of back and forth with customer service saying they'd give me a new kettle without a beeping sound, but they didn't in the end because of my address (which they could've looked at beforehand saving us all a lot of time). I know customer service is tough and I like free stuff. It was a mixed bag overall though most companies these days wouldn't do anything to try to make good and they did so that counts for something.","Makes a beeping noise whenever you put it on the base, push any button and when the water is boiled"
"I purchased two and returned after my husband warned that it would look out of place in my living room, or an area not close to the kitchen. Also the most important thing to note is that there is a glaring solid red light that stays on. This would draw way too much attention to it even if I ignored my husband's suggestion. The camera worked well however the app could be a little more user friendly but it's not terrible. We're going to just invest in a real security system with motion detector nanny cams so they are more inconspicuous.","Constant Red Light made this a ""No go"""

Item arrived barely not expired on bottle....smell and taste like SHIT! not like watermelon mint for damn sure. ive had a million protein shakes and this is by far the worst. i dont even think it tastes the way it initially did when it came in fresh out the assembly. Last but not least was the only product that didnt allow me to return the item although i was able to return other products from this seller.

"I know this tracker is several years old and the technology has improved a lot since then, so I was really not expecting much. I just needed a simple step tracker that clips onto my clothing and syncs with my phone, and the price was incredibly low so I figured why not. I received this tracker on Friday, and by Monday it has stopped syncing with my phone. It worked for 2 days. I have tried troubleshooting this error but cannot fix the problem. I don't know if its the app or the tracker, but either way it was a waste. I also felt like it was not counting enough steps when it was working.

"ok, so I read the reviews before buying. I noticed there were a lot of people saying that it will come off on your clothes and what not. I have to fairly and honestly score it at 50% which I would think is an F.... but it is half of 100% so I gave it 3 stars. This stuff at first looked like it worked GREAT. I had restored the bad spots really well and I did it over several days adding on dye and letting dry in the hot garage. While i was moving it a little sweat fell on it from my face.... I went to wipe it off and with the sweat came due as well.... TALK ABOUT A BUMBER! So I took a wet cloth and wiped it... Just about all of it came off.... now after it was all off, the areas were a little darker than they were before... but clearly still not fixed. so I'm not sure if I need to get a darker color to just do a single coat or what? but I do know that I dont wosh to waste my money again.",read the reviews.... they will give you clues!

The same goes with the fingers and the Large gloves aren't very large any more and I had to struggle to get my not-so-fleshy fingers into the gloves. It would be nice if the sizes were just a bit smaller, but with the odd shapes I don't know if I'll be repeating an online order for these next time and instead find them in a local store so I can try them on first.",Something has changed with the forms they use for fingers and thumbs
